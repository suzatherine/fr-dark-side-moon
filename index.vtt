00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:08.494
[audio playing ...]

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.919
I had just had my first baby, when the

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.219
my done. Revolution of Dignity began in

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.699
2014. There were months of very high

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.369
emotional protests, the whole society

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.265
mobilized.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.660
The government has started to change the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.060
orientation of our politics, from

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.760
European values back to that of the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.030
Russian Union. Hundreds of 1000s on the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.970
streets protested loudly, that we do not

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.425
want this Russian jail in our country.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.670
Ukraine was one of the first ever

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.340
countries to draft the Constitution over

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.750
300 years ago. So we have this roots. We

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.580
were fighting for more than just to be

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.250
European country. It was time to claim

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.635
our identity, our subjectivity.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.600
I was there in winter, with minus 12

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.560
minus 20. With my brown, and a very huge

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.505
pro Ukrainian spirit.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.505
The government responded with cruelty.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.705
Many were beaten, a lot of blood.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.035
More than 100 people were killed.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.790
They paid the price for our freedom with

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.495
the price for our dignity.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.830
Then the Russian invasion began in the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.765
regions of the net Luhansk and Crimea.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.575
And mothers, like loot via the diva

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.142
found strength resist.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:44.165


00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.190
Crimean guitars have a low history of

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.830
repression, and the great story of my

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.650
family is connected with the question of

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.260
fear and exile. I was born in

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.930
Uzbekistan, because my grandparents were

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.590
deported in 1944. And my great great

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.650
grandparents also lived in exile during

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.470
the Russian Empire. Now my generation is

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.595
facing the same thing.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.500
In 2014, I was in my ninth month of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.900
pregnancy, waiting for my fourth child

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.360
to be born. I have never in my life,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.520
seen so many units of military

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.030
machinery, tanks, vehicles, airplanes,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.730
flying above our heads, so many people

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.580
with military uniforms. I was already in

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.980
the hospital. And from my window, I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.740
could see man trying to enter the chief

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.690
physician step out in front of the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.510
soldiers saying, there are ladies here,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.760
and they are about to give birth. If

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.770
anything happens to them, you will

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.230
regret it. This was a man without any

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.750
weapons, and he was standing up for us.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.590
I was terrified. Everyone was expecting

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.720
that the global community would react

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.060
that sanctions would be introduced and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.030
declarations would be made. But nothing

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.340
happened. And the Russian soldiers

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.700
remained in Crimea. When I gave birth,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.100
the nurse said to me, your three oldest

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.380
children will be citizens of Ukraine and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.330
your youngest child, a citizen of the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.610
Russian Federation. It was just a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.250
sentence spoken by a regular woman. But

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.890
it struck me, I realized that something

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.860
had happened in front of my eyes. Russia

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.200
introduced laws in Crimea that allowed

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.910
them to begin the repression machine.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.850
And the mass arrest started. A very good

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.890
friend of mine told me about the search

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.470
in your house, how at 5am they were

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.090
woken up by the sound, the window

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.220
smashing, and last bullying on the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.560
children, uniform man entering with

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.440
machine guards, I can still remember how

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.360
many emotions were in your voice, the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.000
fear and hysteria. That's when I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.430
realized that this horrific situation

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.590
was already knocking at the doors of

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.260
people I knew. And I decided to do

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.080
something about it. The first thing that

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.360
crossed my mind was that I could write

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.400
about the events happening and human

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.680
rights abuses to be the voice of my

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.390
people saying that we are not

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.310
terrorists, that there are people in

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.250
detention centers, teachers, doctors,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.830
entrepreneurs, artists, and they have

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.970
one thing in common, they did no harm. I

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.100
wanted to tell the truth. It was the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.495
call of my heart, my voluntary decision.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.440
This is how the phenomenon of writers

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.260
like me emerged. City journalist taking

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.750
responsibility to speak about the dark

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.365
side of the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.370
Ramadan head started when I was

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.100
arrested. I was carrying bags with food

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.070
when two cars stuck next to me. Unknown

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.840
Men with balaclavas ran out and

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.030
surrounded me. They took me to a police

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.940
department two hours away. For seven

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.030
hours. I was surrounded by these men. I

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.310
remained silent because I didn't trust

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.440
them. And I knew for sure they would

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.970
torture in journalists.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.220
The next day there was a court hearing,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.590
they decided I was guilty. And I had to

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.730
pay a small sum of 2000 rubles. I was

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.640
not surprised at all. It's a way to show

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.470
activists that law enforcement is

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.900
watching you. And what will follow is a

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.630
criminal case in prison. It is a signal

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.270
for you to decide if you want to go on

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.880
or stop and live. That means fewer. They

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.040
wanted to make me scared, but it was

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.560
exactly the other way around. Surviving

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.800
this meant I overcame my fear. I became

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.440
strong enough to stay in Crimea and own

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.065
right in

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.570
the past reflected on my present and

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:48.155
that gave me the strength to fight.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.035
The teach to love war,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.885
to not remember tragedy,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.770
to not pray for the souls of the

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.535
unfortunates

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.220
to not preserve this fragile peace. They

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.400
teach to love war, to be happy that it

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.635
took place to wear a military uniform,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.145
to be proud some debt

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.465
to organize a holiday.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.575
He my great grandfather

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.365
his gardens were here.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.000
Now there are the parades of an ailing

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:38.547
country.

00:06:38.572 --> 00:06:45.214
