00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.660
Russians targets our infrastructure

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.900
creating disasters. Imagine the streets

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.850
We are working on now, without any

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.970
electricity, foods and supermarkets,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.470
restaurants routes quickly without

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.750
refrigeration. And for days there are no

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.240
lights at home in shock windows, from

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.030
street lamps. You learn to keep your

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.010
phone charged and always carry a power

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.470
bank and the torch passers by lights

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.860
have the pavements like fireflies total

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.350
darkness in the city's dangerous hide in

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.010
many obstacles and unknown. But darkness

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.470
also provokes a lot of life. And if you

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.780
look above you, the stars are like big

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.070
clumps. As much as possible, each person

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.200
becomes used to the new role and the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.110
teachers start lessons again, reminding

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.035
their students

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.880
when you hear popping sounds, don't be

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.780
afraid. These are not rockets. That is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.075
our air defense shooting down the soils.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.130
When you hear firework sounds, these

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.340
rockets move away from the windows and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.180
hide behind the walls. When you hear

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.410
whistling sounds that is a plane. The

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.950
plane carries bombs. Lie on the floor

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.190
and cover your head. Open your mouth to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.910
avoid confusion. If the wound is deep,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.360
fly the pressure above the wound. Write

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.240
down the time of application and try to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.960
find the doctor. If you have a panic

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.950
attack, don't breathe deeply. Breathe in

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.850
the package or hold your breath. Four

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.205
times four. wrap yourself in a blank.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.770
hug yourself tightly. Solve a maths

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.425
problem. Don't forget about your exams.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.670
Life is priceless. The world will eat

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:28.865
sweets to replenish calories.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.650
By the middle of spring, lilac starts to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.990
blossom. And it's impossible in the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.880
darkness to understand. If you're

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.010
looking at an outpost covered with white

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.790
nitrile or lilac bushes blooming. It is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.550
something beautiful sunset connected to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.685
war. You can only tell if you smell it.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.650
Even though wars still ongoing send the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.590
back splits as grass and flowers begin

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.070
to grow out of them. Everything becomes

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.030
mixed absurdities with awful things, all

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.560
in one story. But despite how war has

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.470
marked our cities, our greatest treasure

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.770
our people persist. And musicians like

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.560
Charlie's graduate studies go out on the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.870
streets to play amongst the rubble of

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.259
the Belgians

00:03:21.284 --> 00:07:32.785
